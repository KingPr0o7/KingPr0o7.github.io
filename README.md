<h1 align="center">KingPr0o7's / Nathan Parker's Portfolio</h1>

# Background
For a long time, I've wanted to start a website to show my skills to others. This repository represents the many hours of watching YouTube videos, looking at other websites, my found analyses of what to do and not do, and the overall progress of my knowledge of languages such as HTML, CSS, and JS. 

# Intention
The overarching goal of this portfolio is to showcase a bit about myself, my fluency in software languages, and the projects that those languages apply. Also, this website helps me bundle all that into a simple link that anyone can click, view, and share. The website exhibits my growth in learning materials such as HTML/CSS/JS or GitHub technologies. It can also show potential employers or colleges of my improvements and my known highlights to help my future in software development. 

# Instructions

## Building the website
To build my website, you need to run a live server because all assets are referenced relatively rather than specific to your file locations.

### Steps
- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- Install [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) **OR** `npm install -g npm`
- Install [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/) **OR** `npm install vite` 

## Viewing the website

### Development Environment
- Run: `npm run dev`

Also, in `vite.config.js`: you can change what page is on the live server. Change `open: '/src/main-page/index.html'` to another `.html` in one of the folders in the `src` folder. 

### Online
You can view my website on two domains. Those consist of: [KingPr0o7.github.io](https://KingPr0o7.github.io) and [ncp.dev](https://ncp.dev).

## Get Distribution Files (Complied Files)

### Steps
- Install [replace-in-file](https://www.npmjs.com/package/replace-in-file) **OR** `npm install replace-in-file`
- Install [ncp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ncp) **OR** `npm install ncp`
- Install [del-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/del-cli) **OR** `npm install del-cli`
- Run: `npm run build` in the CLI.

All files will be in the dist folder located in the root directory.

## 404 File/Page Not Found (Online Only)
If you encounter a 404 page, it's likely that your URL doesn't match a file in the source. For example: `ncp.dev/main.html` or `ncp.dev/loading.html`. These URL locations have been removed and are no longer in the code base.

The other reason is that GitHub is down (If you're viewing the website online), which you can check via [GitHub Status Website](https://www.githubstatus.com/) & [GitHub Status Twitter](https://twitter.com/githubstatus)
