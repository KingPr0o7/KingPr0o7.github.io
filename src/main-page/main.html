    <p id="about-text">
      <span id="about-paragraph-header">BACKGROUND</span><br><br>I'm Nathan Parker or rather known as KingPr0o7 on the web. In my experience, I love working with technology in any way possible, whether that be on a Nintendo Wii or high-end personal computers that connect to billions of people. My father was the one to introduce me to these technologies, and because of that, I plan on pursuing a career that can improve these technologies. Currently, a sophomore in high school and got a while to achieve that goal. Hopefully, I'll be able to work with others to achieve goals that many people thought were impossible. So one day, anyone globally can view and benefit from what I or others built and integrate into their lives. With that in mind, I structure my projects to be the best possible so that everyone is in sync and running without problems. These projects take longer to complete, especially if by myself. Therefore I'm constantly trying to balance delivery times and the appearance/functionality of the projects. 
      <br><br>
      <span id="about-paragraph-header">GOALS</span><br><br>I have many goals and tend to jump on projects when a new idea strikes me. This website was an example of this, and before, I was developing a Super Mario Brothers game on Code.org. My main goal for each project is for all to have ease of use and general enjoyment of each project. I hate when sites, games, or companies put roadblocks to the main idea of their projects, making the end user more frustrated than enjoying their creations. I strive to eliminate or reduce all roadblocks in every project I develop to improve the end user's experience. The community helps me expand, improve and gives me new views. This website serves the purpose of showing the community all my projects and about myself so that I can get feedback and outreach. Over time I'll gain more experience to apply my knowledge to work with teams of people to accomplish the impossible. While at the same time providing to the community that helped me along the way. 
      <br><br>
      <span id="about-paragraph-header">PROPHECY</span><br><br>When it comes to the future, I have many things in mind, but I have to see what sticks to the dart board before I throw my shot. I have goals to focus on working with teams of people to program things to life, though as a sophomore in high school, there isn't much for that. Though, something that is sticking is my fluency and logical understanding of several software development languages. These languages are HTML, CSS, Javascript, SkriptLang, Python, and more. With that, I'm currently scouting colleges that can help further my knowledge, understanding, teamwork, and use of technological tools for a career in software development. Once those stick in place, everything builds on top of itself to qualify me further to achieve my dream and live life in the United States of America. Those are pending goals, but I'll get to them here in a few years, and these types of things must go right because they're my future.
